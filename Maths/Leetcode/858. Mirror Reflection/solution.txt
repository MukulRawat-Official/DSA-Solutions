  we have give p and q;
  p -> whole x axis
  q -> partial / whole y axis
  
  since it is sqaure all side will be 'p'
  
  now to collide ar one corner  (p * k ) % q == 0
  k = 1 , 2 , 3 .....  (k == no of reflections)
  
  eg:-  all sides are 3 cm and we get 1 cm as y 
  now to reach one corner  need 3 * y  (k = 3 reflections)
  
  from above formaula we can be sure laser / ray will meet one end
  now one point is where will ray meet upper or lower end. (end == floor)
  
  for that we'll calc
  
   (p * k) / q  = x (it indicate total length of veritacal axis needed)
   
   if (x is odd we'll be at upper corner)
   else lower corner.
   
   here if   x  = 1, 3 , 5 ie odd it will meet at upper corner
   else for even it will meet at lower corner  (ie 0 mirror)
  
   now for upper corner we can check by same formule 
   by value of k
   
   for odd value of k -> it will meet at mirror 1 (it simple you can observe it from example)
   for even value of k-> it wil meet at mirror 2
  
 
class Solution {
public:
 
     int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
      
     int k = 1;
        
     while(k * q % p)  // no of reflections
        k++;
        
        
     if( (k * q) / p % 2 == 0 ) return 0;   // it shows laser meet at lower end
	 
	 // for upper floor we can check by total no of reflections made
	 
     if(k%2) return 1;
     return  2;
     
    }
