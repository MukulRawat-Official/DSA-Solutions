/*
   maths question 
   
   points to be noted:-
   
   1.> every stage size if decreased by two
   2.> if we deleted from left answer will surely be deleted 
       by how much -> not since our array is reducing by two elements that reaming their gap will also increase by twice
   3.> by right side our answer will only be deleted if element are odd
       eg:- 1 2 3 4 5  -> 2 4  , 1 2 3 4 -> 1 3 
       so our answer will only change when its odd in right turn .
