  note both houses are indepenet of each other so we can form combination of one house and multiplity it with other
  
  since problem is repitive we need to make recursive function
  
  at 0 spot chancse = 1;
  at 1 spot chaces = 2; (1 empty and 1 full)
  
  for more than 2 sport we have recurr(n-1) + recurr(n-2);
  ie either we take spot or we leave it
